1.create git repo and clone it in local
2.create mycode.py and add code to it.(it will save csv file to a new "Data" folder)
3.git add commt push before dvc
4.# pip install dvc
5.Now we do "dvc init"(creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
6. Now do "mkdir s3"(create a new s3 directory)
7.Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
8.Next 'dvc add data/'  #keep track of every change
(to tell to keep track of specific file so dvc add data/path)
9.Next 'dvc add data/'
now it will ask to do:("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
10.again we do "dvc add data/" (create data.dvc ) the "git add .gitignore data.dvc"

11."dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
12.got commit and git push
13. now make changes in my_code.py to append a new row in data, check changes vai 'dvc status'
14.again --- "dvc commit " then 'dvc push'
